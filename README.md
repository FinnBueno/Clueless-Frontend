# Clueless
Clueless is an online party game, inspired by the popular game [Codenames](https://codenames.game/). A live version of the game can be found [here](http://clueless.peakfinn.nl/). This repository hosts the frontend part of the game, built using React and Typescript.

## Installation
To run this repository, you will need a .env file. An empty example of this file has been provided in [.env.example](.env.example). The values that go into this file are secret, and the actual .env file should never be pushed to any repository ever. For obvious reasons, the values connecting this project to Clueless' database will stay secret. However, you can create a Firebase project yourself and get the required values for the .env file yourself, and then use those instead. You can find out how to setup a Firebase project [here]()

Once you've got your .env file setup, simply run these commands to start the project:
```
npm install
npm start
```
And you're done!
